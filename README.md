# Swift Panel
A Pterodactyl Panel Clone using Javascript

## Why????
I was very much interested in making [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel) addons, but I lacked the knowledge of **PHP**, I once thought of learning it but couldn't make up my mind. So instead I rewritted it in Js (One of the Most Used Languages).

## Challenges!
Initially, I thought of using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) but it bacame very challenging specially with the app router. I had to use client side rendering on almost every page, which killed the purpose of using Next.js.
I researched online for 2 ~ 3 days, tried many frameworks and then found [Adonis.js](https://adonisjs.com/) not very popular but it left a good impact on me at the first try. And I continued using it. I also wanted to ensure that any existing Projects based of [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel) is compatible with SwiftPanel, so I had to made all API routes and their Request and Response the same as Ptero.

## Development
First of all I made Database from an exported database of [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel), then I made all the API endpoints Application, Client and Remote with the help of [Pteronotes](https://github.com/devnote-dev/ptero-notes) and [Dashflo](https://dashflo.net/docs/api/pterodactyl/v1/).
And then onto making Admin Pages, I thought of making all pages on my own, which took me a week just to make 2 pages, I dropped the idea and just copy pasted all the Admin pages from [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel) which still took a lot of time, converting Blade to Edge, Adding routes, etc.
For the Client side despite the struggles I made own pages.
**It's still not complete, but I decided to pause the development for a while due to my exams in January, I will continue it after than**

## Note
This project is not at all related with [Pterodactyl Panel](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel), do not ask them anything about it<br/>
Running on your own hardware - **This version is not ready for production yet**, the connection between SwiftPanel and Pterodactyl Wings currently require some special configurations which I will be fixing after my exams. Have patience :v:
