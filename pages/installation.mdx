## Download files

First, create a directory for the panel files. This can be anywhere on your server, but we recommend `/var/www/panel`.

```bash
mkdir -p /var/www/panel
cd /var/www/panel
```

Next, download the latest version of the panel from the [releases page](https://github.com/itzshubhamdev/swiftpanel/releases).

```bash
curl -Lo panel.zip https://github.com/itzshubhamdev/swiftpanel/releases/latest/download/panel.zip
unzip panel.zip
```
